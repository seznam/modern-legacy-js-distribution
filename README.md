# Modern Legacy JS Distribution

This repository solves the problem of writing modern JavaScript, while still supporting old browsers. This is a simple, bare-bone setup that serves static JavaScript files, but can easily be extended for larger projects.

The core technologies used are:

- Webpack
- Babel
- Core-js
- Nginx
- Docker
